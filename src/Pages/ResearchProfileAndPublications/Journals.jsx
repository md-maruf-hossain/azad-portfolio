      overview:
        "The depletion in non-renewable energy sources and a fast-growing population in Bangladesh are exacerbating the already existing energy scarcity, highlighting the need for an efficient and robust renewable-energy supply chain. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the most optimized renewable-energy supply chain based on natural resource availability and government policies of Bangladesh. In the present study, four renewable energy resources, including solar, biomass, wind and hydropower, are studied and nine subcriteria are defined under four primary criteria for each supply chain. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) are multicriteria decision-making approaches used in this study to compare and choose the best renewable-energy supply chain. The relative significance of four supply-chain criteria for primary renewable energy in this study, namely energy procurement, production, operations and maintenance costs, and social and environmental impact, is gathered via a survey. The results of this research, supported by a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, indicate that hydropower is the best renewable-energy supply chain, followed by wind as a compromise solution, biomass and solar. The study also demonstrates that no energy source can satisfy all supply-chain criteria alone; each resource is better for a specific criterion—solar is better for procurement, hydropower is significant for production and wind is remarkable for operations and social impact. Therefore, to maximize output, renewable energy sources must be integrated. From Bangladesh’s perspective, for the first time, by using TOPSIS and VIKOR together, this study offers significant insights to establish an efficient and sustainable renewable-energy supply chain for practitioners, academics and policymakers.",

      overview:
        "In general, the design process of renewable energy systems focuses on life cycle costs, but when it comes to sustainability, only the emissions are considered rather than the life cycle impact assessment of the systems. This research presents a four-tier methodology for designing renewable energy systems that balance cost-effectiveness and sustainability for electrification in remote areas. Tier 1 involves understanding the community context by analyzing electrical load profiles, meteorological data, and component specifications for microgrid design. Tier 2 assesses feasibility and optimizes systems using cost analysis and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to rank energy system alternatives. Tier 3 evaluates environmental impacts through life cycle assessment, ranking alternatives based on environmental criteria. Tier 4 integrates cost and environmental rankings to identify the most viable energy configurations, followed by sensitivity analysis to ensure robustness. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through a case study of an unelectrified remote community, showcasing the performance of the optimal microgrid solution and validating the four-tiered approach. This research introduces a novel framework for renewable energy system design, balancing cost and sustainability, and provides a scalable solution for rural electrification in developing regions.",

      overview:
        "In many developing nations, open landfills are the primary method for managing municipal solid waste (MSW), contributing significantly to methane emissions into the atmosphere. This study focuses on estimating methane emissions and assessing the potential for energy recovery at the Nawdapara Landfill Site in Bangladesh over the period from 2004 to 2022. Methane generation was modeled using several approaches, including the USEPA LandGEM model (version 3.02), IPCC's Zero-Order Decay Method (ZODM), First-Order Decay Method (FODM), and the Modified Triangular Method (MTM). The ZODM model demonstrated the highest energy recovery potential (1.54 MW/year), whereas the MTM yielded the lowest (0.206 MW/year). The models rely on variables such as annual rainfall, temperature, and MSW volume for the study area. Statistical machine learning techniques, including correlation and regression, were applied to examine the relationship between methane generation potential and these climatic and waste-related factors. Theoretical models for ZODM and MTM successfully captured the full range of methane variability, while the FODM and LandGEM models explained 92.3% and 92.6%, respectively, of the variance in methane production. The novelty of this research lies in the application of advanced statistical machine learning tools to uncover the complex interactions between methane output and environmental variables, addressing existing gaps in knowledge and offering new insights to inform waste management practices globally.",

      overview:
        "This research focuses on innovative approaches to improving the performance and efficiency of solar tracking systems through the development of the Solar Tracking and Analysis Research (S.T.A.R.) framework. It begins by designing and implementing both open- and closed-loop solar tracking systems, followed by a year-long data collection process, which includes daily energy generation measurements over a 10-hour period. The second phase of the study conducts an in-depth evaluation of these systems across varying weather conditions, identifying their advantages and limitations to propose optimization strategies. Through detailed design, testing, and analysis, inefficiencies are detected, and targeted improvements are suggested to enhance system performance. These findings are incorporated into a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (MOGA ANFIS) that optimizes solar tracking by considering various solar and environmental factors. The primary goal is to optimize the tilt and azimuth angles of solar panels to maximize energy output. The study compares energy generation data from an AI-enhanced solar tracking system with traditional methods, providing both theoretical and experimental insights into its performance. The results show that the AI-based system, driven by MOGA ANFIS, consistently surpasses conventional tracking systems under different weather scenarios, achieving R² values of 0.989 for azimuth angle predictions and 0.998 for altitude angles, demonstrating its superior adaptability and precision. Experimentally, the AI system produces 27% and 20% more energy than open- and closed-loop systems, respectively, and offers up to 57% more energy than fixed panels. This research makes a substantial contribution to renewable energy, particularly in advancing solar tracking technologies.",

        "Robotics and automation are often employed to manage hazardous situations such as natural disasters and pandemics to minimize casualties. However, the high cost and complexity of these technologies have created barriers for healthcare systems in rural, remote areas, and developing nations. This research aims to address this issue by designing an Arduino-based robot that can dispense medications, provide instructions, measure oxygen saturation, and monitor patient body temperatures, thus minimizing direct contact between healthcare workers and patients with infectious diseases. A survey conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh, assessed the needs of healthcare professionals, and through Quality Function Deployment (QFD), these user requirements were translated into specific engineering criteria. A functional framework was developed to meet these needs, and an electronic circuit was designed to ensure the robot performs its tasks efficiently. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and simulations were conducted to validate the structural integrity and safety of the device. The results demonstrated that the robot’s components can support over 40 N of weight while maintaining cost-effectiveness and operational reliability. In conclusion, this affordable and easily manufacturable device has the potential to transform healthcare delivery in underdeveloped regions worldwide.",

        "This study addresses the escalating environmental and public health concerns associated with rising medical waste (MW) volumes by developing an accurate methodology for forecasting MW through machine learning (ML) models. Utilizing comprehensive data from Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH), Bangladesh, spanning 2016 to 2023, the research incorporates key variables such as indoor and outdoor patients, number of surgeries, and indoor deaths. Various ML algorithms, including Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Random Forest (RF), are evaluated using performance metrics like MAE, RMSE, R-squared, and MAPE. The findings reveal strong positive correlations between the identified variables and MW generation, with LR emerging as the most reliable model, showing the lowest mean squared error and highest R-squared values. Projections indicate a substantial rise in MW over the next seven years, highlighting the need for proactive waste management strategies. The study also emphasizes the importance of patient-related factors in forecasting different types of MW and recommends tailored approaches to manage general, infectious, recyclable, sharp, and other waste categories. This research establishes a comprehensive framework for precise MW forecasting, which is essential for optimizing resource management, improving operational efficiency, and advancing environmental sustainability in healthcare.",
